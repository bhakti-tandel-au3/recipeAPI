1.Create a new project
--> django-admin.py startproject projectName projectLocation
--> This will create one folder with projectName and manage.py file. projectName folder 
    has multiple files. If we do not specify destination it will create one folder with 
    projectName and inside that creates above files.

2. Create a app inside project
--> python3 manage.py startapp appName
--> This will create one folder with appName and model, view, test and other files 
    within that folder.

3. Installing apps
--> We can add via external dependency (requirements.txt file) or by creating app and 
    adding it to the installed apps in setting.py file. INSTALLED_APPS contains list 
    of apps that we are using in out project. 

4. Start the django project
--> python3 manage.py runserver host:port
